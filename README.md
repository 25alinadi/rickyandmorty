# Ricky And Morty Project

The Rick and Morty API is a free and public API that offers a wide range of information about the show. It serves as a valuable resource for developers who want to incorporate "Rick and Morty" data into their own applications, websites, or projects. The API provides a simple and structured way to access various endpoints and retrieve data in a machine-readable format, usually in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

By utilizing the Rick and Morty API, developers can access data such as character information, episode details, location data, and even retrieve random quotes from the show. This allows them to create applications that display character profiles, generate quizzes, build episode guides, or even develop interactive games based on the "Rick and Morty" universe.

I try to create website similarly to main website and use https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql for get data and showing to client.

I use reactjs, typescript, MUI, tailwind css and for state management use redux-toolkit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
